# Suppressing the following Bandit vulnerabilities:
# Issue: [B106:hardcoded_password_funcarg] Possible hardcoded password: '' (Low severity)
# this is an invalid category since empty string is not a hardcoded password

# Issue: [B107:hardcoded_password_default] Possible hardcoded password: '' (Low severity)
# this is an invalid category since empty string is not a hardcoded password

# Issue: [B324:hashlib] Use of weak MD5 hash for security. Consider usedforsecurity=False (High severity)
# suppressing this because md5 is not being used for security purposes.
# Not using the recommended usedforsecurity=False argument since it could have unintended effects.

# Issue: [B110:try_except_pass] Try, Except, Pass detected. (Low severity)
# this is an invalid category since the flow is expected

# Issue: [B112:try_except_continue] Try, Except, Continue detected. (Low severity)
# this is an invalid category since the flow is expected

# Issue: [B108:hardcoded_tmp_directory] Probable insecure usage of temp file/directory. (Medium severity)
# this is an invalid category since the flows are invoked from Lambdas and temporary files,
# which are purged promptly, are required for processing statements and for tests

# Issue: [B101:assert_used] Use of assert detected. The enclosed code will be removed when compiling to optimised byte code.
# tests need to have asserts, this is an invalid vulnerability highlight

# Issue: [B105:hardcoded_password_string] Possible hardcoded password: '05de8576-4636-11ed-b878-0242ac120002'
# necessary for running tests

# Issue: [B301:blacklist] Pickle and modules that wrap it can be unsafe when used to deserialize untrusted data, possible security issue.
# tight coupling with the flow, can't be updated without an overhaul, which is not functionally necessary

# Issue: [B113:request_without_timeout] Requests call without timeout
# a sync response is expected, hence no timeout

# Issue: [B311:blacklist] Standard pseudo-random generators are not suitable for security/cryptographic purposes.
# not using this library for cryptographic purposes

# Issue: [B405:blacklist] Using xml.etree.ElementTree to parse untrusted XML data is known to be vulnerable to XML attacks. Replace xml.etree.ElementTree with the equivalent defusedxml package, or make sure defusedxml.defuse_stdlib() is called.
# tight coupling to existing flow
